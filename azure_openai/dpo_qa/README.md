# DPO Fine-Tuning GPT-4o Model - A Python SDK Experience  
  
This guide provides a structured approach to fine-tuning the `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with the Python SDK. It details the steps necessary to execute the process either locally or on Azure Machine Learning (AML) using a CPU Compute Standard_D13_v2 and Python 3.10 - SDK v2 environment.  
  
## Prerequisites  
  
To successfully follow this tutorial, ensure you have the following:  
  
- **Azure Subscription**: Active subscription with access to Azure OpenAI Service.  
- **Azure OpenAI Resource**: Created in a supported fine-tuning region (e.g., Sweden Central).  
- **Deployment of GPT-4o Base Model**: Simplified as "gpt-4o".  
- **Training and Validation Datasets**: Minimum of 50 high-quality samples formatted in JSON Lines (JSONL) document with UTF-8 encoding.  
- **Python Environment**: Version 3.10 with libraries including `os`, `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `matplotlib`, `azure.identity`, `pandas`, and `openai` (version 1.58.1).  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Recommended for executing the code.  
- **Azure Credentials File**: An `azure.env` file to store credentials securely.  
  
## Setup  
  
1. **Retrieve API Credentials**: Access the Azure portal to find the API key and endpoint of your Azure OpenAI resource.  
2. **Configure Environment**: Install required Python libraries and configure credentials using the `azure.env` file.  
3. **Test Connectivity**: Validate Azure OpenAI connection by sending a test completion request.  
  
## Data Preparation  
  
- **Generate Dataset**: Use GPT-4o to create 200 training samples and 50 validation samples with both preferred and non-preferred outputs.  
- **Upload Datasets**: Use the Azure OpenAI SDK to upload the JSONL files for fine-tuning.  
  
## Fine-Tuning Process  
  
1. **Configure Fine-Tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters such as beta, batch size, and learning rate multiplier to optimize the training process.  
2. **Submit Fine-Tuning Job**: Initiate the job using DPO with specified parameters.  
3. **Monitor and Evaluate**: Check job status and retrieve metrics to evaluate training performance.  
  
## Deployment  
  
- **Deploy Fine-Tuned Model**: Utilize Azure's Control Plane API to deploy the model for use.  
- **Test Model**: Conduct tests to validate performance improvements over the base model using pre-selected questions.  
  
## Evaluation  
  
- **Compare Models**: Assess the tone and quality of responses generated by the base and fine-tuned models using a set of test questions.  
- **Visualize Results**: Generate comparison charts to display the distribution of answer labels and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DPO fine-tuning.  
  
## Cleanup  
  
- **Delete Deployment**: Ensure to delete the deployed model once testing is complete to avoid hourly hosting costs.  
  
By following this guide, users can successfully fine-tune and deploy a GPT-4o model using DPO to align it with desired response preferences, achieving more positive and insightful outputs.
